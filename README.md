## How to use
The overlay can be used without further registration or installation.

### 1. Get the URL of the overlay
The overlay is currently hosted on GitHub Pages.  
So the base URL currently is: `https://darmiel.github.io/twitch-poll-overlay/`.  
The channel has to be specified as the parameter: `?channel=<your channel name>`:


-> http://darmiel.github.io/twitch-poll-overlay/index.html?channel=\<your channel here\>


There are a few more optional parameters.  
The easiest way is to use the 
[Parameter-Builder for twitch-poll-overlay](http://darmiel.github.io/twitch-poll-overlay/builder.html)

### 2. Stream-Software setup
In the following I will show the setup using [OBS](https://obsproject.com), but this should be possible with any other streaming program.

#### a) Create a browser source:
![img](assets/hiw-create-browser.png)

#### b) Paste the copied URL at `URL`
![img](assets/hiw-url-browser-source.png)

#### c) Adjust Width and Height
**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Please make sure that **only here** the size is adjusted.  
If you resize the browser source afterwards with your mouse, problems **will** occur.

#### d) Enter at Custom CSS:
```css
body { 
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); 
    margin: 0px auto; 
    overflow: hidden; 
}
```

#### Done! Finally click again on "Refresh cache of current active".
Your Browser source should look something like this:

## Why?
I don't now.. I had this idea for a while now, and I just wanted to extend my TypeScript knowledge and experiment a bit with Webpack. Besides, it **might** be a little help for one or the other streamer / viewer üòÅ.
